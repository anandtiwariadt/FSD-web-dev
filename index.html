    <p >The Story of Chhutki, the Little Gilehri (Around 700 words)

Dense green trees surrounded the edges of Sundarvan Forest, and in the middle of those tall giants lived a tiny, lively gilehri named Chhutki. She was smaller than other squirrels, with shiny brown fur and a fluffy tail that curled like a question mark. Chhutki loved running along the branches, leaping between tree to tree, and gathering nuts for her secret little store. Though she was small, her dreams were bigger than the entire forest.

Every morning, when golden sunlight seeped through the thick leaves, Chhutki woke up before everyone else. With sparkling eyes, she greeted the day and rushed out to explore. She believed every sunrise brought a new adventure, and she never wanted to miss a single one.

One day, as she climbed down her favorite banyan tree, she found her friend Mittu, the parrot, sitting quietly on a branch. “Chhutki,” Mittu chirped, “a storm is coming tonight. You should gather your food quickly.”

Chhutki nodded. She knew storms could be harsh in Sundarvan. Heavy winds shook branches, and rainwater flooded the ground. But she wasn’t scared. Instead, she decided to collect as many nuts and seeds as she could before evening. She ran from tree to tree, squeezing into small cracks, peeking under leaves, and searching for anything that could be useful during the storm.

By afternoon, she had collected a huge pile of acorns, walnuts, and berries. She looked at her collection proudly. "This will last me for days!" she said to herself. But little did she know, nature had different plans.

As the sun began to set, the sky suddenly turned dark. Thick clouds gathered overhead, and the wind howled like an angry wolf. Leaves flew everywhere. Branches creaked. The animals of Sundarvan rushed to their shelters, and Chhutki hurried to carry her precious nuts into her home. She tried to pick them up, but the wind grew stronger and stronger.

Before she could react, a fierce gust swept across the forest, scattering her entire collection in every direction. Acorns rolled down the hill, walnuts bounced off rocks, and berries were carried away like tiny boats in the wind. Chhutki froze, her heart sinking.

“My food…!” she whispered softly.

By the time the storm ended late in the night, the forest was silent again. But Chhutki couldn't sleep. She kept thinking about all the hard work that had been blown away in seconds. She felt small, helpless, and alone.

At dawn, when the first rays of sun warmed the forest floor, Chhutki stepped out, hoping to find at least a few nuts nearby. But the ground was washed clean. Not a single one remained.

Tears filled her eyes. “Why does this happen to me? I worked so hard…” she murmured.

Just then, she heard a familiar voice. “Chhutki!” It was Mittu, flying toward her with something shiny in his beak. When he landed, he dropped two large walnuts before her.

“For you,” Mittu said gently. “I found these stuck in the branches after the storm.”

Chhutki’s eyes widened in surprise. She hadn’t expected anyone to help. Before she could thank him, more of her friends began arriving. Golu the monkey brought berries, Bholu the rabbit brought seeds, and even the slow-moving tortoise, Kambu, pushed a small pile of acorns toward her.

All of them said the same thing:
“You never hesitate to help us. Today it’s our turn.”

Overwhelmed, Chhutki couldn't hold back her tears — but this time, they weren’t tears of sadness. They were tears of gratitude. She realized something important: when you spread kindness, it always finds a way back to you.

With her friends’ help, Chhutki rebuilt her food storage. By evening, her little home was full again — maybe even fuller than before the storm. She sat in the middle of her cozy nest, her heart warm and peaceful.

Looking out at the forest glowing under the setting sun, Chhutki whispered to herself,
“Storms may scatter my hard work, but not my spirit. Because I am never truly alone.”

And from that day forward, she faced every challenge with courage, knowing that strength doesn’t always come from size — sometimes it comes from heart, friendship, and never giving up.</p>
